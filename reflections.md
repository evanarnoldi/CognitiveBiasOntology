# ðŸ’¡ Reflections

After working on the project, we've found several reflections about several things that we've encountered during the project:

### LLM Usage

* LLMs (e.g. ChatGPT) is a powerful tool which require moderation in usage, but when utilized properly, can save up a lot of time.
* Although LLMs appear to knowledgeable and capable of high-reasoning capabilities at first, closer inspection reveals that their answers are often times rather unreliable, thus requiring additional surveying from the user in order to validate the informations.

### Cognitive Biases & Ontology Development

* Each cognitive bias is both similar to the others, especially when looking inside the cognitive clusters, but also quite different. As such, developing one single ontology to include them all is a possibility that requires some further planning and, as to not disrupt the functioning of each bias by means of a correct structuring of the ontology.
* As mentioned above, the similarity between some of the biases is so strong that they could also be seen as interchangeable, as in two biases or more can inhabit the same ontology using the same terms (Example: Von Rostorff and Picture Superiority both uses the same ontology, utilizing the same Classes and Properties, with the difference being the described Individuals).
* Defining the Competency questions that an ontology must answer before creating it will smooth the developing progress thanks to the clarity that the questions bring to the table.
* Flexibility is crucial when developing an ontology. However, flexibility does not mean that there are no set rules or guidelines to be followed.
* When both flexibility and guidelines are used properly and concurrently, the outcome will result much clearer and satisfactory.

| <p>I generally found the project both challenging and enlightening. Developing ontologies from scratch is quite a daunting task, more so when given the flexibility to decide the classes, properties, and individuals ourselves. At the beginning, doubts were evidently clouding our thoughts, making it hard to progress at a meaningful pace for our project. However, as time went on and after several consultations, I personally found that the project was challenging in an exciting way, rather than tedious.</p><p></p><p>Although I am not yet sure how the previous ontologies would fare in terms of proper ontology creation, I hope that they reflect my enthusiasm in creating my own ontologies for cognitive biases. Furthermore, these ontologies can hopefully also contribute to the progress of ontology creation for cognitive biases, which I assume to be the purpose of the final project in this course.</p><p></p><p>As Prof. Gangemi said before: <em>the more you wrong, the more you learn.

| <p>Developing an ontology is not easy. The hardest part of the project has been for me, ironically, the freedom that the developer has in the creation of the ontology. This freedom can very easily lead astray, resulting in many different ideas and ways of developing a semantic representation of the very same concept, often quite contradictory among themselves. <br>Following a strong methodology such as the eXtreme Design one can help with defining a more clear path toward the completeness of the ontology, as can reusing Ontology Design Patterns for common concepts found in the ideas one is trying to represent in their ontology. </p> |

<table><thead><tr><th>Nicole's Personal Reflections</th><th data-hidden></th><th data-hidden></th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>Dealing with ontologies has been challenging and thus also enjoyable. I believe that AI has been a very useful resource, but it is a technology not mature enough to be fully relied upon when it comes to ontology creation. From these real-world tests, it is evident to me how important it is to consult a domain expert.</td><td></td><td></td></tr></tbody></table>
